abstract: "Cavitation bubbles induce impulsive forces on surrounding substrates,
  particles, or surfaces. Even though cavitation is a traditional topic in fluid
  mechanics, current understanding and studies do not capture the effect of
  cavitation on suspended objects in fluids. In the present work, the dynamics
  of a spherical particle due to a cavitation bubble is experimentally
  characterized and compared with an analytical model. Three phases are
  observed: the growth of the bubble where the particle is pushed away, its
  collapse where the particle approaches the bubble, and a longer time scale
  postcollapse where the particle continues to move toward the collapsed bubble.
  The particle motion in the longer time scale presumably results from the
  asymmetric cavitation evolution at an earlier time. Our theory considering the
  asymmetric bubble dynamics shows that the particle velocity strongly depends
  on the distance from the bubble as an inverse-fourth-power law, which is in
  good agreement with our experimentation. This study sheds light on how small
  free particles respond to cavitation bubbles in fluids."
